## wsurvey.floatingContent.js

*wsurvey.floatingContent.js* is part of the   [wsurvey.lib repository](https://github.com/dHellerstein/wsurvey.lib) .
It can be used alone (it does require jQuery)



### Summary
 The javascript functions in #wsurvey.floatingContent make it easy to create **floating** -- moveable and resizeable -- containers.
  Within a  floatingContent container there will be a fixed header area (top line of the container).
  And a scrollable content area.  Both which can easily be updated with new content.

  #### Note
  -If you download just these (and not the full wsurvey.lib.zip) 
   - to use the demo, you will need to edit the code a bit: change  `<script ...>` so they point to the where you saved the .js files! 
   - be sure to also download wsurvey.utils1.js 
  
  - An older (semi-deprecated) version of this can be found in the [show content respostitory](https://github.com/dHellerstein/showContent)
