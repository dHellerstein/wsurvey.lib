## wsurvey.dropdown.js : javascript functions to create html drop down menus.

*wsurvey.dropdown.js* is part of the   [wsurvey.lib repository](https://github.com/dHellerstein/wsurvey.lib) .
It can be used alone (it does require jQuery)

### Summary
 wsurvey.dropdown() quickly creates one or more dropdown menus.

   Each dropdown menu will be automatically formatted to display a vertical list of bullet-like boxes,
   with highlighting that changes as the mouse moves over ("hovers") over each box.

   wsurvey.dropdown can be highly customized. Each dropdown menu (and you can create as many as you choose)
   can be positioned and styled to your liking.

  #### Note
  If you download just these (and not the full wsurvey.lib.zip) 
   - to use the demo, you will need to edit the code a bit: change  `<script ...>` so they point to the where you saved the .js files!
